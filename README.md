# UK Portfolio WordPress Plugin

UK Portfolio is a WordPress plugin that adds a custom post type "Project". By having custom post types in a separate plugin, your content remains intact across different themes. It also registers separate project taxonomies for tags and categories.

This plugin doesnâ€™t change how projects are displayed in your theme. You will need to add the some templates if you want to customize the display of projects.
